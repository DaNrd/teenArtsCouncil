Palo Alto Children’s Theatre exists to nurture the intellectual, artistic, and personal development of children and youth through multi-arts education, performing opportunities, and extraordinary theatre experiences. We believe process and product are of equal importance and aim to create excellent theatre for young audiences. Through multi-arts education, Children’s Theatre develops lifelong skills such as critical and creative thinking, cooperation, and aesthetic sensitivity.

A theatre and a school, Children’s Theatre provides classes and programming designed to further learning experiences for children and youth. This invaluable teaching tool develops skills and provides an excellent opportunity to develop our participants’ theatrical knowledge.  The Palo Alto Children’s Theatre is part of the City of Palo Alto Community Services Department.
