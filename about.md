Teen Arts Council has been an initiative of the Palo Alto Children’s Theatre since 2009. We conceive of, plan, and produce arts events with the goal of strengthening the youth community in Palo Alto and the greater peninsula. The Teen Arts Council also works as a leadership training program for its members. All time spent working with the Teen Arts Council or at the Palo Alto Children’s Theatre counts as community service; many of our members qualify for the President’s Volunteer Service award each year.


We meet every Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. at the Palo Alto Children’s Theatre, and we love to have new members, so if you’re interested, please come. If you want, you can let us know you’re coming by sending an email to teenartscouncil@gmail.com.


**MISSION:** The Teen Arts Council is a creative community of Palo Alto teens dedicated to enriching the lives of their peers through artistic expression. Towards this end, we coordinate events and projects inspired by the passions of council members. We take pride in connecting teens with the financial and logistical resources to carry out their imaginative ideas.


**VISION:** To sustain and expand a supportive space for local teen leaders in the arts to take creative risks.
